<para>The alternative to <olink targetdocent="buildmake.xml">using
make</olink> is to use XSLT extension functions. Naturally this will
only be possible if you're using a processor for which the extensions
have been implemented. The Website distribution includes extensions
for Xalan and Saxon.</para>

<para>You can still use other processors such as
xsltproc or MSXML with this method, but the file dependencies won't be
tracked.  Dependency tracking means the process can avoid having to 
reprocess XML files that have not changed.
So with xsltproc, all the XML files will be processed every time
it is run.</para>

<note>
<para>If the source pages for your website are stored in several
files, this method will probably will not work correctly all the time.
The extension can only see if the <quote>main</quote> page has
changed, not subsidiary pages that it (logically) depends on. If you
have a complex source layout, you will probably have to <olink
targetdocent="buildmake.xml">use make</olink>.</para>

Do this by processing your <filename>layout.xml</filename> with the

website.
